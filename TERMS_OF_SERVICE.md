# Terms Of Service

This document outlines the Terms of Service for the Discord bot PokeBooster. By using the bot, you agree to comply with these terms, which govern its usage, features, and limitations.

## Usage Agreement

By inviting PokeBooster and using its features (commands), you agree to the Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy outlined below. You acknowledge that using the bot is a privilege, not a right, and that you may freely use it on any Discord server where it is present. You may also invite the bot to servers where you have the "Manage Server" permission.

This privilege can be permanently revoked if you violate PokeBooster's ToS or Privacy Policy, or if you breach Discord's Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or Community Guidelines.

By inviting the bot, you consent to the collection of specific data as described in its Privacy Policy. This data is strictly used for core functionalities, such as command processing and feature management, and is not shared with third parties.

## Affiliation

PokeBooster is an independent Discord bot and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or created by Discord Inc. Any resemblance to Discord's trademarks, branding, or intellectual property is purely coincidental. We do not claim ownership of any Discord assets, trademarks, or other intellectual property.

Additionally, PokeBooster is not produced, endorsed, supported, or affiliated with Nintendo, The Pokémon Company, or any of their subsidiaries. All Pokémon-related content, including card images, names, and designs, remains the intellectual property of The Pokémon Company.

## Usage

All uses of PokeBooster, being a Discord application, must firstly comply with the Discord Terms of Service. The use of the bot via autoclickers, macros, or any form of automation (botting) is strictly forbidden. PokeBooster must be used under normal playing conditions. Commands should not be spammed or used excessively to slow down the bot, the APIs, or the libraries used for informational commands.

Each user is allowed only one account to interact with PokeBooster. Alternative, duplicate, or shared accounts are strictly prohibited. Using multiple accounts to gain unfair advantages, evade cooldowns, bypass restrictions, or manipulate game mechanics is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban.

PokeBooster requires certain permissions to function correctly. These permissions must be granted when inviting the bot to a server; otherwise, some features may not work as intended.

## Bug abuse.

Exploiting bugs is strictly prohibited. If you discover a bug or witness any rule violations, please report them immediately in the #bug-reports channel or to a staff member. Ensure that your report includes clear evidence (such as screenshots or any other relevant proof) to help us take swift action. Intentionally abusing a bug will result in a permanent ban.

Additionally, falsifying or submitting misleading bug reports, especially in the support server, is not tolerated and may also lead to a permanent ban.

## Ban evasion

Circumventing a ban by using an alternate account or having others post messages on your behalf is strictly prohibited.

This includes, but is not limited to:

-   Using a secondary account to bypass a server or game ban.
-   Asking or allowing others to send messages on your behalf while you are banned.

Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban from both the server and the game for all accounts involved.

## Trade

All exchanges, sales, and purchases must be conducted fairly and transparently. Both parties must reach a mutual agreement before proceeding with any trade.

Engaging in fraudulent activities, such as refusing to complete payment after receiving a card, intentionally misleading another user, or exploiting loopholes in the system, will result in a permanent ban. All trades are final. PokeBooster does not provide refunds, reversals, or mediation for completed trades.

Users are responsible for ensuring that trades are fair and secure, and should exercise caution when dealing with unfamiliar users. If a scam is confirmed, appropriate actions will be taken.

## Scamming

Scamming is strictly prohibited. Failure to honor a trade agreement will result in a permanent ban for all accounts involved. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   Refusing to complete a trade after receiving an item.
-   Baiting users into purchasing overpriced cards.
-   Manipulating market prices in an extreme or deceptive manner.

## Loans & Lending

Loaning coins or cards is strongly discouraged. If you choose to do so, you assume full responsibility for any potential losses. PokeBooster does not mediate or enforce loan agreements between users.

## Liability

The owner of PokeBooster is not responsible for any violations of these Terms of Service committed by individual users. Users are expected to act in good faith, provide truthful information, and refrain from misusing the bot or Discord’s services in a malicious manner. Any misuse is the sole responsibility of the offending user.

We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes, and a 7-day (one-week) opt-out period will be provided. If you do not agree with any changes, you have a 7-day (one-week) opt-out period. You may opt out by removing the bot from any server where you have the necessary permissions. Continued use of the bot after this period constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## Contact

If you need assistance or have any inquiries regarding PokeBooster, you can reach out through the official Support Discord Server or by direct messaging the bot owner. Additional support channels may be available, but their availability is not guaranteed.
